SproutCore HTML5 Application Framework
 
SproutCore is a framework for building blazing-fast, desktop-like applications 
in the web browser using only native HTML5 features. With SproutCore, you 
build rich, interactive applications in the web in less code than most simple 
web pages require today.

The easiest way to get started with SproutCore is using the BlueRibbon build 
tools included with the SproutCore package when you install it from the Ruby 
Gems.  Please see the Getting Started documentation on the SproutCore website
for more information.
