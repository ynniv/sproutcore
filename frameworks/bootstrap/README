SproutCore Bootstrap

This framework contains some basic setup code that should be inserted at the 
top of an HTML page.  The default code included here will detect the current
browser and add class names to the body tag to allow CSS rules to be applied 
to specific platforms.

If your loading HTML does not care about the specific platform you are on,
you can generally leave this framework out of your main code.  The same class
names will be added to the run sc-pane as well.
